<h1>Venue Details</h1>

<br>
<p>
The decrypting diversity summit will bring you to the city of Montpellier.
Montpellier lies in southern France near the Mediterranean Sea. One of the largest urban centres in the region of Occitania, Montpellier is the prefecture of the department of Hérault. The ca. 300 000 inhabitants are called Montpelliérains.
It has an amazing historical city center (called Écusson), is ca. 15km from the sea in the south and has some nice mountains (called Cevennes) in the north.
In June the weather is hot and dry - so bring your swimming suit and light clothes. However, the big conference room has air condition, so best bring some long-sleeves as well.
