<h1>Venue Details</h1>

<br>
<p>
The decrypting diversity summit will bring you to the city of Montpellier.
Montpellier lies in southern France near the Mediterranean Sea. One of the largest urban centres in the region of Occitania, Montpellier is the prefecture of the department of Hérault. The ca. 300 000 inhabitants are called Montpelliérains.
It has an amazing historical city center (called Écusson), is ca. 15km from the sea in the south and has some nice mountains (called Cevennes) in the north.
In June the weather is hot and dry - so bring your swimming suit and light clothes. However, the big conference room has air condition, so best bring some long-sleeves as well.

<strong>Travelling to Montpellier</strong>
</p>
<br>

<p><i>By plane:</i></p>
<p>Montpellier's airport is called Aéroport Montpellier Méditerranée (MPL) and is situated in the south-east of Montpellier, ca. 10 km from the city center.
</p>
<p>To reach the city center by public transport, you have to take a bus shuttle (called navette) to the tram station "Place de l'Europe" from which you can take tram line 1 to the city center. The schedule of the bus shuttle can be found <a href="https://www.herault-transport.fr/sites/default/files/fiches-horaires/ligne-rg/620-mars-FH-accessible.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
More information on how to access the airport can be found <a href="https://www.montpellier.aeroport.fr/en/passengers/parking-access/access" target="_blank">here</a>.
It is a rather small airport, so it is not very likely you will get a good connection to it.</p>

<p>Alternative airports in the region are the Nîmes airport (FNI), Marseille airport (MRS), Lyon airport (LYS) and Paris airport (CDG).
From those airports you can either <a href="https://www.sncf-connect.com/" target="_blank">book trains</a> to Montpellier or <a href="https://www.flixbus.fr/" target="_blank">various</a> <a href="https://www.blablacar.fr/bus" target="_blank">busses</a>.</p>

<br>
<p><i>By train:</i></p>
<p>Montpellier has two main train stations: Montpellier Saint-Roch and Montpellier Sud de France.
The Saint-Roch train station is pretty much in the city center, whereas the Sud de France train station lies ca. 10km outside of the city.
More and more of the fast trains (called TGV) do not enter the city center anymore and only stop at the Sud de France train station.
From there, you have to take a bus shuttle (called navette) to the traim station "Place de l'Europe" from which you can take tram line 1 to the city center. Overall, you can plan around 1h to reach a hotel in the city center from the southern train station.</p>

<br>
<p><i>By bus:</i></p>
<p>Montpellier is accessible by bus from many European cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Liège, Florence, Milan, Rome, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Bucharest, etc.). It is serviced by <a href="https://www.blablacar.fr/bus/destinations/montpellier-2" target="_blank">Blablabus</a>, <a href="https://www.flixbus.fr/bus/montpellier" target="_blank">Flixbus</a>, Linebus (from Spain) and <a href="https://www.herault-transport.fr/plan-reseau" target="_blank">LIO</a> (within the Hérault region).
