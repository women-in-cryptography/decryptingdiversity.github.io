        <h1>Decrypting Diversity</h1>
				<br>
				<p>A summit with the goal of promoting diversity, inclusivity, and gender equality within the cryptography community. Let's strengthen community connections and facilitate scientific collaborations, and provide a dedicated space for the cryptography community to develop actionable strategies and long-term plans to foster a more inclusive and diverse environment.</p>
				<p>The summit will happen on 16-20 June in Montpellier, France.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The summit was born as an idea from the <a href="https://www.womenincryptography.com/" target="_blank">"Women in Cryptography"</a> (WINC) community, but extends beyond it.
				It will be held both online and in person, enabling participation that extends well
beyond regional boundaries and making the discussions and presentations long-term available. It is specifically designed to engage individuals from underrepresented communities, including those from historically marginalized regions. The idea is to hear from communities such as Criptolatino, a network for Latin American cryptographers, and Queer in Cryptography, a network for LGBTQIA+ cryptographers. We plan to actively invite their members to join. A central focus of the summit will be intersectionality, recognizing that discrimination often arises at the intersection of multiple factors such as gender, geography, and socioeconomic status, and addressing the fact that security is not one-size-fits-all: different groups encounter distinct challenges based on their unique circumstances, environments, and vulnerabilities.</p>
