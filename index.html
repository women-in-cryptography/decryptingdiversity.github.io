        <h1>Decrypting Diversity Summit</h1>
          <img src="/assets/decrypting_diversity_logo_full.jpg" class="main-img" alt="Home logo">
				<p>A summit with the goal of promoting diversity, inclusion, and gender equality within the cryptography community. Our goal is to strengthen community connections and facilitate scientific collaborations by providing a dedicated space for the cryptography community to develop actionable strategies and long-term plans for fostering a more inclusive and diverse environment.</p>
				<p><strong>The summit happens from the 17th to the 20th June in Montpellier, France.</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p>
				<strong>Our event is hybrid! </strong> we welcome participation beyond regional boundaries. It is specifically designed to engage individuals from underrepresented communities, including those from historically marginalized regions. Hence, a central focus of the summit is <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/books/255/" target="_blank">intersectionality</a>, recognizing that discrimination often arises at the intersection of multiple factors such as race, gender, geography, and socioeconomic status, and addressing the fact that security is not one-size-fits-all: different groups encounter distinct challenges based on their unique circumstances, environments, and vulnerabilities.
			  </p>
				<p>The summit is an idea from the <a href="https://www.womenincryptography.com/" target="_blank">"Women in Cryptography"</a> (WINC) community, but extends beyond it.
