<h1>We are looking for sponsors!</h1>
<p>
In order to make this summit happen, we need sponsorship! Congruent to keep with a summit that strives for diversity and inclusivity, we have decided to not accept sponsorship from organizations and companies that support the arms trade or conflict in war zones, do not engage on climate justice or are known for their discriminatory practices. The sponsorship will allow us to give scholarships to students from under-represented communities and make the event awesome! Also, let us know if someone from your universities would like to participate.

If you will like to sponsor us, please message us at <code>sponsors at decryptingdiversity dot com</code>.
