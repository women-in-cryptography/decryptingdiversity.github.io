  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Our summit is structured around four key categories, ensuring a diverse and inclusive program that brings together participants from different geographic and scientific backgrounds.
Our primary goal is to document ideas and plan concrete actions to better support underrepresented groups in cryptography while showcasing the exceptional career paths and research contributions of these communities.
Additionally, we aim to foster potential scientific collaborations among members of the cryptography community from underrepresented backgrounds.
</p>
<p>We will have: a. Scientific Presentations, b. Diversity Discussions and c. Education Workshops.

    <h3>Scientific Talk Title: <em>Theoretical aspects of practical cryptography</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Marta Bellés Muñoz</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
My experience with zero-knowledge proof systems has largely been driven by practical needs, which eventually led to theoretical results. In this talk, I will present the most significant outcomes, including work on arithmetic circuits and the study of elliptic curves. The highlight is a result showing that no known families of pairing-friendly curves are involved in a 2-cycle with any pairing-friendly curve of cryptographic interest (beyond the well-known MNT cycles).</p>

    <h3>Educational Workshop Title: <em>Workshop on Impostor Syndrome</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Natacha Portier</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
Impostor Syndrome is a widespread phenomenon: 70 percent of people have experienced feelings of fraudulence in their life. It is especially significant among high achieving women and academics of every gender. The syndrome is characterized by not owning your own success, thinking other people overestimate you and fearing being found out. It can be hugely detrimental to the accomplishments of one’s goal and to the well-being of the person experiencing it.
<br>
The aim of this 3 hours workshop is to learn how to recognize the Impostor Syndrome in one’s thinking and to know which strategies to put into place to prevent it in order to reach your professional goals. This will be accomplished by awareness-raising through questioning and shared experiences, introducing theoretical input and giving practical implementation.
