  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Our summit is structured around four key categories, ensuring a diverse and inclusive program that brings together participants from different geographic and scientific backgrounds.
Our primary goal is to document ideas and plan concrete actions to better support underrepresented groups in cryptography while showcasing the exceptional career paths and research contributions of these communities.
Additionally, we aim to foster potential scientific collaborations among members of the cryptography community from underrepresented backgrounds.
</p>
<p>We will have: a. Scientific Presentations, b. Diversity Discussions and c. Education Workshops.

    <h3>Scientific Talk: <em>Theoretical aspects of practical cryptography</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Marta Bellés Muñoz</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
My experience with zero-knowledge proof systems has largely been driven by practical needs, which eventually led to theoretical results. In this talk, I will present the most significant outcomes, including work on arithmetic circuits and the study of elliptic curves. The highlight is a result showing that no known families of pairing-friendly curves are involved in a 2-cycle with any pairing-friendly curve of cryptographic interest (beyond the well-known MNT cycles).</p>

    <h3>Scientific Talk: <em>Cryptographic proofs for privacy and integrity</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Chaya Ganesh</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
A common denominator of conventional financial systems, trusted execution environments (like SGX), blockchain technology, and ZK-rollups is the promise of computational integrity -- doing the right computation on potentially secret inputs, even when there is no trust.
<br>
In this talk, we will define computational integrity and show how one can verify the correctness of a computation much more efficiently than having to re-perform the computation. We will introduce the notion of succinct proof systems that allow a prover to convince a verifier about the correctness of computation such that verification is exponentially faster than the computation itself, and zero-knowledge where the verifier learns nothing beyond the truth of the statement. We will see applications of zkSNARKs (Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge), a kind of succinct arguments in decentralized systems like blockchain technology for both privacy and scalability issues, and outline the design principle underlying zkSNARK constructions.</p>

    <h3>Educational Talk: <em>Data Sovereignty under Tyranny</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Kylie Ariel Bemis</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
The rise of AI and high-tech government surveillance pose new challenges to the worldwide struggle for human rights and liberties. Nowhere is this more apparent than the descent of the United States of America into authoritarianism, which has prominently featured the use of generative AI and attacks on citizens’ private data within the federal government. Tyranny in the 21st century relies not only on fear through military might, but also the breakdown of truth, data privacy, and reliable provenance of information.
<br>
Indigenous communities are painfully familiar with this brand of technological tyranny, but it is a new threat for the majority of Americans and many others living in backsliding democracies. However, based on lessons from around the world, there are ways for nonviolent civil resistance movements to fight back against authoritarianism. Experts in digital security and data privacy will play a vital role in these movements to defend the human rights, liberties, and data sovereignty of vulnerable communities and nations.

    <h3>Educational Workshop: <em>Workshop on Impostor Syndrome</em></h3>
    <p><strong class="bold">Speaker:</strong> Natacha Portier</p>
    <p><strong class="bold">Abstract:</strong>
Impostor Syndrome is a widespread phenomenon: 70 percent of people have experienced feelings of fraudulence in their life. It is especially significant among high achieving women and academics of every gender. The syndrome is characterized by not owning your own success, thinking other people overestimate you and fearing being found out. It can be hugely detrimental to the accomplishments of one’s goal and to the well-being of the person experiencing it.
<br>
The aim of this 3 hours workshop is to learn how to recognize the Impostor Syndrome in one’s thinking and to know which strategies to put into place to prevent it in order to reach your professional goals. This will be accomplished by awareness-raising through questioning and shared experiences, introducing theoretical input and giving practical implementation.
