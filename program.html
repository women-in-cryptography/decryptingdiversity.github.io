<h1>Provisonal program</h1>
<p>
Our summit is structured around four key categories, ensuring a diverse and inclusive program that brings together participants from different geographic and scientific backgrounds.
Our primary goal is to document ideas and plan concrete actions to better support underrepresented groups in cryptography while showcasing the exceptional career paths and research contributions of these communities.
Additionally, we aim to foster potential scientific collaborations among members of the cryptography community from underrepresented backgrounds.
</p>
<br>
<p>We will have: a. Scientific Presentations, b. Diversity Discussions and c. Education Workshops.
</p>

<h1>Call for Poster Submission</h1>
<p>
During the four-day event, we will organize poster session(s), to display the achievements made in our community. The achievements can be of scientific nature (e.g., a research internship, a publication, a software package) as well as of a more community centered nature (e.g., you are involved in a program dedicated to girls promoting computer science and programming, or you are involved in a particularly diverse CTF group, or you are involved in other types of efforts promoting diversity in cryptography or neighboring areas).
</p>
<br>
<p>
We especially encourage submissions of people who are part of one or multiple underrepresented groups.
To give some examples of underrepresented groups in the cryptography community, this could relate to you gender, your sexual orientation, your race, your age, your geographic origin, your religion, your body.
