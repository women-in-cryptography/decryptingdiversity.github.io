      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-bell%C3%A9s-mu%C3%B1oz-4883b7167">Marta Bellés Muñoz</a>,
      <em>Researcher at Dusk Network and Teaching Assistant at Pompeu Fabra University, Spain</em><br>
      She studied mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and later pursued a master's degree in Mathematics at Aarhus University. During those years, she combined her academic work with a career in classical music. In 2018, she returned to Barcelona and joined a project developing a blockchain-based identity system. Shortly after entering the blockchain space, she began her PhD at Pompeu Fabra University, where she focused on the use of elliptic curves in zero-knowledge proof systems. Today, she continues to teach at Pompeu Fabra University while working for a Dutch blockchain company called Dusk.<br>

      <a href="https://kuwisdelu.github.io/index.html">Kylie Ariel Bemis</a>,
      <em>Assistant Teaching Professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, USA</em><br>
      Kylie Bemis holds a B.S. in Statistics and Mathematics, an M.S. in Applied Statistics, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University. In 2013, she interned at Stanford's Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection, where she developed the Cardinal software for statistical analysis of mass spectrometry imaging. In 2015, she received the John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award from the American Statistical Association. After a postdoc with the Olga Vitek lab at Northeastern University, she joined the faculty in 2019 to teach and develop curriculum for the MS in Data Science program. Her research interests include machine learning and statistical computing for bioinformatics.<br>
      While at Purdue, she led the Purdue AISES chapter and served as secretary for the Native American Student Association. She is a Rising Hearts Athlete Advocate for the Native American, LGBTQIA+, and neurodivergent communities. An enrolled member of the Zuni tribe, she is also a fiction and poetry writer. Her work appears in "Nameless Woman: An Anthology of Fiction by Trans Women of Color" (2018), "Maiden Mother Crone: Fantastical Trans Femmes" (2019), and "Transcendent 4" (2019).

  <h2>Panelists</h2>
<p>
We will have two panel discussions on the topics of:
<ul class="inside-list">
    <li><b class="bold">Panel 1 - Advocating for Diversity:</b>
     We hear from people involved in different initiatives, events, and communities who advocate for diversity and inclusion in the field of cryptography and security, and talk about their success as well as their challenges.

    <img src="/assets/speakers/ChrisBrzuska.jpg" alt="Chris Brzuska" class="speaker-img">
    <div>
      <a href="https://www.chrisbrzuska.de/">Chris Brzuska</a><br>
      Chris' research is in cryptography, where he particularly enjoys showing that something is impossible (e.g., random oracle uninstantiability or the impossibility of building one-way functions from weaker assumptions). He also works on real-world key exchange protocols (e.g., TLS, MLS, EMV), leveraging modular techniques (like state-separating proofs) and formal verification.<br>
      Chris is a faculty member in the departments of Computer Science as well as Mathematics and Systems Analysis at Aalto University in Finland. Previously, he was a junior professor at TU Hamburg, postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge and Tel-Aviv University, and PhD student of Marc Fischlin at TU Darmstadt (PhD in 2012).<br>

    <li><b class="bold">Panel 2 -  Breaking the Cycle:</b>
    In this panel, we aim to discuss how, at different career stages, we can break the cycle of behaviours that unintentionally hinder diversity and inclusion. We aim to explore how to recognize and address these patterns in order to create a more inclusive environment.
