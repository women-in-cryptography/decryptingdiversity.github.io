      <em>Researcher at Dusk Network and Teaching Assistant at Pompeu Fabra University, Spain</em><br>
      She studied mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and later pursued a master's degree in Mathematics at Aarhus University. During those years, she combined her academic work with a career in classical music. In 2018, she returned to Barcelona and joined a project developing a blockchain-based identity system. Shortly after entering the blockchain space, she began her PhD at Pompeu Fabra University, where she focused on the use of elliptic curves in zero-knowledge proof systems. Today, she continues to teach at Pompeu Fabra University while working for a Dutch blockchain company called Dusk.<br>

  <h2>Panelists</h2>
<p>
We will have two panel discussions on the topics of:
<ul class="inside-list">
    <li><b class="bold">Panel 1 - Advocating for Diversity:</b>
     We hear from people involved in different initiatives, events, and communities who advocate for diversity and inclusion in the field of cryptography and security, and talk about their success as well as their challenges.
     <ul class="inside-list">

     </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b class="bold">Panel 2 -  Breaking the Cycle:</b>
    In this panel, we aim to discuss how, at different career stages, we can break the cycle of behaviours that unintentionally hinder diversity and inclusion. We aim to explore how to recognize and address these patterns in order to create a more inclusive environment.
