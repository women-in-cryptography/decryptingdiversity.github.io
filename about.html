<h1>Decrypting Diversity Summit</h1>
<p>
<strong>Dates:</strong> 17–20 June 2025.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Location:</strong> Montpellier, France (Hybrid: In-person & Online).
</p>
<br>
<p>
The <i>Decrypting Diversity Summit</i> is a groundbreaking initiative dedicated to fostering diversity, inclusivity, and gender equality within the cryptography and security research community. This four-day event will bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and industry leaders from diverse backgrounds to strengthen community connections, facilitate scientific collaborations, and develop actionable strategies for building a more inclusive and representative field.
</p>
<p>
By offering both in-person and virtual participation options, the summit ensures broad accessibility, allowing individuals from around the world—especially those from historically underrepresented or marginalized communities—to join the discussions. Additionally, key presentations and discussions will be recorded and made available after the summit, ensuring that the impact of these conversations extends well beyond the event itself.

<p>
<strong>Key Goals of the Summit:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Promote Diversity & Inclusion:</i> Create an environment where researchers from underrepresented backgrounds feel welcome, supported, and valued.
	</li>
	<li>
  <i>Address Intersectionality in Security & Cryptography:</i> Recognize that challenges related to discrimination and access to opportunities often stem from multiple intersecting factors such as gender, geography, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status.
	</li>
	<li>
  <i>Develop Long-Term Strategies for Change:</i> Move beyond discussions to actionable plans and commitments that institutions, organizations, and individuals can implement to improve inclusion, equity, and representation in the field.
